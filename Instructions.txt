How to setup Internet sharing with an iPhone and raspberry pi

1. Install Raspian on raspberry pi: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
2. Update and upgrade system: 

pi# sudo apt update & sudo apt upgrade

3. Install usb handler to connect iPhone: 

pi# sudo apt install usbmuxd

4. Connect iPhone and enable iPhone hotspot, select “trust” when prompted, and check that you get a new interface eth1 with an IP: 

pi# sudo ifconfig -a

5. Create bridge: 

pi# sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/bridge-br0.netdev

5.1 Add the following lines in the file:

[NetDev]
Name=br0
Kind=bridge

5.2 Ctrl+X to save and exit.

6. Make eth0 member of the bridge: 

pi# sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/br0-member-eth0.network

6.1 Add the following lines in the file:

[Match]
Name=eth0

[Network]
Bridge=br0

6.2 Ctrl+X to save and exit.

7. Make eth1 member of the bridge: 

pi# sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/br0-member-eth1.network

7.1 Add the following lines in the file:

[Match]
Name=eth1

[Network]
Bridge=br0

7.2 Ctrl+X to save and exit.

8. Enable the systemd-networkd service to create and populate the bridge when your Raspberry Pi boots:

pi# sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd

9. Set static fallback IP, make sure DHCP is not handed out on eth0 and eth1, and make br0 handle DHCP-requests:

pi# sudo cp /etc/dhcpcd.conf /etc/dhcpcd.conf.back

pi# sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

9.1 Add to the top of the file:

# Disable DHCP on interfaces that are bridged:
denyinterfaces eth0 eth1

9.2 Comment out following in the static IP section (change IP information to fit your network):

# It is possible to fall back to a static IP if DHCP fails:
# define static profile
profile static_eth0
static ip_address=192.168.0.65/24
static routers=192.168.0.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1

# fallback to static profile on eth0
interface eth0
fallback static_eth0

9.3 Add as last lines:

# Add bridged interface:
interface br0

9.4 Ctrl+X to save and exit.

10. Reboot: 

pi# sudo reboot now

11: Connect iPhone via USB and connect Ethernet to laptop and check you get an IP on your laptop from the iPhone (typically 172-range): 

pi# sudo ifconfig -a
